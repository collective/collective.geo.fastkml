Introduction
============

collective.geo.fastkml replaces the template based generation of
collective.geo.kml with the objectoriented approch of fastkml
https://github.com/cleder/fastkml

collective.geo.fastkml does support Polygons and MultiPolygons with holes.
Depending how many holes your polygons have it may take longer to generate
you KML file with collective.geo.fastkml (as collective.geo.kml ignores
the holes). Generally collective.geo.fastkml is slightly faster than
collective.geo.kml and produces smaller files

The style for polygons is created from the linestyle and polygonstyle so
polygons can have an outline that is diffrent from the polygon fill style

collective.geo.fastkml does not have an interface of its own, it just
overrides the kml-document view of collective.geo.kml.
