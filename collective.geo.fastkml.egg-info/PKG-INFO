Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        collective.geo.fastkml replaces the template based generation of
        collective.geo.km with the objectoriented approch of fastkml
        https://github.com/cleder/fastkml
        
        collective.geo.fastkml does support Polygons and MultiPolygons with holes.
        Depending how many holes your polygons have it may take longer to generate
        you KML file with collective.geo.fastkml (as collective.geo.kml ignores
        the holes). Generally collective.geo.fastkml is slightly faster than
        collective.geo.kml and produces smaller files
        
        The style for polygons is created from the linestyle and polygonstyle so
        polygons can have an outline that is diffrent from the polygon fill style
        
        collective.geo.fastkml does not have an interface of its own, it just
        overrides the kml-document view of collective.geo.kml.
